# Inverter Shader
This github repo is for a random shader I just thought of making while coding mods. It inverts colors, or a some people might say, makes the colors negative. This branch is to test out new functions and stuff like that.

# Commits
Please, commit if you want because I'm trying to make this a open source shader, unlike most (well they are but usually you have to ask to remix, please do ask me though kek)
Also, Thanks to Ian Gilman for committing.


# Stuff
I won't always work on this I might be working on my other one, [SharpenShaders].
